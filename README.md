# Alex Styles Portfolio

This project is a responsive, interactive portfolio site built with Blazor WebAssembly.

## Copilot Assistance

- **Activity 1 (Foundational CSS)**  
  Copilot generated the initial CSS structure including typography, colors, and layout grids.

- **Activity 2 (Responsive Design)**  
  Copilot suggested media queries for mobile and tablet breakpoints and helped reorganize the Contact form and Portfolio grid.

- **Activity 3 (UI/UX Enhancements)**  
  Copilot provided hover effects for buttons and portfolio items, a modal component for project details, and tooltips for navigation links. It also suggested improvements to typography and color scheme for better branding.

With Copilotâ€™s assistance, I was able to build a professional, responsive, and interactive portfolio site in three phases.
